- 🔭 I’m currently working on: Flower Power
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: Unity DOTS

I’m a final-year student studying Games Design and Development with an endorsement in programming at the University of Greenwich. I also took a placement year at Unity Technologies as a Sustained Engineer before moving into my third and final year. I’ve had a passion for programming ever since my first project with Scratch when I was 13 years old, and since then had a strong interest in learning new programming languages, going from Python, to Java, to web development with HTML and CSS, then to C# and C++ which are my core languages now. I also now have three years of experience in developing games and applications with Unity, as well as well 3 months experience developing games with Unreal Engine in C++.

I am currently looking for a Graduate Developer role to start after I graduate in July 2022, and am open to any experiences or opportunities available! I am spending my final year taking a focus on optimisation and will be using Unity DOTS for my final year project to compare object-orient and data-oriented programming. That said, I am always open to learning new skills and concepts and have experience in lots of different areas of such as 2D, 3D, mobile, and Virtual Reality development.
