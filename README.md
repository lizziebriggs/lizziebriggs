Hi! I’m Lizzie and I'm currently working as a Software Engineer in the UI team at Criterion Games, based in Guildford.

In 2022, I graduated from the University of Greenwich with a first-class honours in Games Design and Development with an endorsement in programming, and was awarded "The School of Computing and Mathematical Sciences Prize for Outstanding Undergraduate Achievement in the Games and Digital Media Programmes". As part of my course, I took a placement year at Unity Technologies as a Sustained Engineer.

I’ve had a passion for programming ever since my first project with Scratch when I was 13 years old, and since then had a strong interest in learning new programming languages, going from Python, to Java, to web development with HTML and CSS, then to C# and C++ which are my core languages now. My passion for games then led me onto the path for games development, and since beginning university in 2018, have gained experience developing games using Unity and Unreal Engine.

I spent my final year taking a focus on optimisation and used Unity DOTS for my final year project to compare object-oriented and data-oriented programming. I am always open to learning new skills and concepts and have experience in lots of different areas of such as 2D, 3D, mobile, and Virtual Reality development.
